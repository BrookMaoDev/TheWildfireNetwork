## Inspiration

Our web app stemmed from the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires in the country. Over the past few years, Canada has been experiencing a rising number of wildfires that have had significant ecological, economic, and human impacts. We created this app in efforts to combat this national and worldwide disaster.

## What It Does

Our app uses feedparser to scrape news headlines, selects those relating to wildfires, and displays them on the homepage. Our wildfire prediction uses an algorithm with real-time data gathered from WeatherAPI to calculate the risk of fire anywhere around the world. Furthermore, we provide users with support resources as well as the opportunity to donate to help wildfire prevention and rescue efforts.

## How We Built It

We used Django as the back-end framework, with Python handling API requests and web scraping. On the front-end, HTML/CSS was used alongside Bootstrap for styling.

## Challenges We Ran Into

- Dealing with merge conflicts in the initial production
- Difficulty getting packages to work together
- Problems passing information from the back-end to the front-end

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

- Successfully implementing the weather and news API into the web app
- Fixing bugs, solving problems, and deepening our understanding of web development
- Creating a working and decent-looking web app as new developers

## What We Learned

- How to work together and use version control to collaborate
- As novice web developers, we had a lot to learn about the libraries and frameworks before starting out
- How to integrate APIs into an application

## What's Next for The Wildfire Network

Next, we might enhance the algorithm by using historical data to analyze trends and patterns to more accurately make predictions. A comprehensive and working payment feature could also be added, which would allow users to donate real money to wildfire rescue organizations around the globe.
