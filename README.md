## Inspiration

Our web app was inspired by the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires in Canada and globally. We created this app during **Ignition Hacks 2023, a 36-hour hackathon,** to help combat this growing disaster. üåçüî•

## What It Does & How We Built It

Our app uses **feedparser** to scrape news headlines, selects those related to wildfires, and displays them on the homepage. The wildfire prediction feature uses an algorithm with real-time data from the **WeatherAPI** to calculate fire risk worldwide.

We built the app using **Django** as the back-end framework, with **Python** handling API requests and web scraping. The front-end was developed using **HTML/CSS** with **Bootstrap** for styling.
